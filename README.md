An old website I developed for an online game server community in 2012.

The site included a custom-built forum with BBCode support, private messaging, a news section, an administrative section, and more.
Players could buy VIP packages through Paypal and the server would automatically configure the game server to apply changes.

The website was built in 2012. I was still learning PHP and web technologies at the time so the code isn't all that pretty, but it worked.

At its peak the site had several thousand registered accounts, but only a few dozens were active daily.
